Mindset & Attitude

1. Focus on learning, not winning. Rolling is practice; your goal is to improve, not to beat training partners.
2. Be coachable. Accept corrections gracefully, even if feedback contradicts what you think you know.
3. Celebrate small victories. Surviving 10 extra seconds in mount or remembering to keep elbows in IS progress.

Training Habits & Consistency

4. Write down what you learned after every class. Review notes before the next session.
5. Set small, specific goals. "This week: keep elbows tight." "This month: survive side control."

Technical Focus

6. Keep elbows tight to your body (T-Rex arms). Extended arms get armbarred.
7. Grip with intention, not desperation. Death-gripping gases your forearms in 30 seconds. Grip when needed, release when not.
8. Focus on position before submission. Spend 80%+ of time on positional control, escapes, and survival.
9. Learn the fundamental positions and how to move between them: Mount, Side Control, Guard (closed/open/half), Back Control, Turtle.
10. Prioritize defense and escapes. The best white belt skill is being hard to submit.
11. Move your hips, not just your arms. Hip escapes (shrimps) are the engine of BJJ.
12. Play guard. Guard is where BJJ lives; neglecting it will leave you behind.
13. Drill the basics. Shrimps, bridges, technical stand-ups are your foundation.

Etiquette & Conduct

14. Don't coach from the sidelines or during rolling unless asked.

What You Should Not Do

15. DON'T move erratically. Always move deliberately and with control.
16. DON'T do techniques you haven't been taught.
17. DON'T reach behind you when someone is on your back. Protect your neck, control their hands, and work your escape.
18. DON'T post your hands on the mat from bottom positions. It exposes your arms to kimuras and armbars. Frame on your opponent's body instead.
19. DON'T cross your ankles when you have someone's back. It gives up a free ankle lock. Keep hooks in properly.
20. DON'T try to submit from inside guard. Pass the guard first.

Progress in BJJ is not linear. You'll feel stuck, and then one day everything clicks.
